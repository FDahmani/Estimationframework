# Estimationframework

In this repository, the code and input files of my thesis, titled 'Obrit Estimation of Minor Jovian Satellites', can be found. The code forms a framework for the initial state estimation for small moons. The following files are found in the repository:

Observations: Raw observation files, taken from the NSDC website, sorted between inner and outer moons. 
ObservationsProcessed: Observation files that were uniformised to a Tudat-compatible format. 
Sim_ISE: code for the initial state estimation based on simulated perfect SPICE observations, known as the prefit in the thesis
Obs_ISE: code for the initial state estimation based on real astrometric observations
